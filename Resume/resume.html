    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> &nbsp &nbsp I was born into a world of computers and have always been fascinated by them. After a long journey filled with challenges and hard work, I found myself returning to my true passion—computers. It's surprising that it took me so long to switch fields. </p>

<p>  &nbsp &nbsp I graduated with a degree in English Language Teaching and genuinely enjoyed the job. However, I soon realized that the education system in my country seemed to belong to those who were more concerned with their egos than with the welfare of students. Many teachers were too harsh on children, focusing on a select few "successful" students rather than nurturing a successful community. As someone who struggled in school, I believe everyone has the potential to be saved and change their lives.

I didn't want to kick "unsuccessful" students out of the classroom or yell at them. I wanted to befriend and support them. However, the pressure from principals, colleagues, and the system to conform to a narrow definition of success became overwhelming. Perhaps I should have stayed and fought for change, but instead, I chose to leave.</p>

&nbsp &nbsp   After leaving teaching, I worked as a ship agent, leveraging my language skills. This time, the issue wasn't the people or the job itself—it was me. I couldn't connect with that career. <br>

Now, I'm back to where I started, working with computers and doing what I love most.
